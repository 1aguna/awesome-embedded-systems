## Packages, Libraries and RTOSes

### Communication

- [nanopb](https://koti.kapsi.fi/jpa/nanopb/) - Nanopb is a plain-C implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers data format. It is targeted at 32 bit microcontrollers, but is also fit for other embedded systems with tight (2-10 kB ROM, <1 kB RAM) memory constraints.

### Testing

- [CppUTest](https://cpputest.github.io/) - unit testing and mocking framework for C/C++ with a focus on working for embedded systems!
- [ceedling, unity and cmock](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/) - Unit testing, mocking and build framework written in C with ruby for generating and building.

### Frameworks

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
- [ARM mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/) - The ARM mbed IoT Device Platform provides the operating system, cloud services, tools and developer ecosystem to make the creation and deployment of commercial, standards-based IoT solutions possible at scale.

## Resources

### Podcasts

- [Embedded](http://embedded.fm/) - Elicia White and Christopher White interview makes, hackers and engineers who work on embedded systems
- [The Amp Hour](http://www.theamphour.com/)
- [Sparkgap](http://thesparkgap.net/)

### Videos

- [EEVBlog](https://www.eevblog.com/) - More on the electronics side, but David L. Jones tears apart embedded systems and electronic devices.

### Books

- [Making Embedded Systems by Elicia White](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Embedded-Systems-Patterns-Software/dp/1449302149) - Covers the basics of embedded systems architecture, design and patterns.
- [Test Driven Developmet for Embedded C by James Grenning](https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) - How to approach test driven development for embedded devices written in C.

### Standards

- [Embedded C Coding Standards](http://www.barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/Books/Embedded-C-Coding-Standard) - Coding standards for embedded C from the Barr Group.

### Tools

- [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org/) - PlatformIO is an open source ecosystem for IoT development
Cross-platform build system. Continuous and IDE integration. Arduino and ARM mbed compatible

### Courses

- [edX Embedded Systems Course by University of Texas Austin](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-03x)
